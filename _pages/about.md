I am a PhD candidate in [Electrical Engineering](http://ee.caltech.edu) at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu), advised by [Prof. Babak Hassibi](https://www.ee.caltech.edu/people/hassibi). My research is broadly centered on the interplay between control theory, optimization, and machine learning, mainly focusing on the robust and adaptive control of dynamical systems under uncertainty.

Previously, I earned my M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Caltech in 2023 and my B.S. in Electrical and [Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://ee.bilkent.edu.tr/en/), and B.S. in [Physics](https://physics.bilkent.edu.tr/) from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/). During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research under the mentorship of [Prof. Tolga Ã‡ukur](https://kilyos.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~cukur/). Additionally, I interned at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/tag/alexa), where I worked with [Dr. Kevin Small](http://www.kevinsmall.org), and at the [National Magnetic Resonance Research Center](https://umram.bilkent.edu.tr).
